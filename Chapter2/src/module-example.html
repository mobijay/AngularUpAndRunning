<!-- Modules is Angulars way of packaging relevant code under a single name.
This is equivalent to packages in Java.
Modules can define its own controllers, services, factories and directives. These are functions and code that
can be accessed throughout the module.
The module can also depend on other modules as dependencies which are defined when the module is instantiated.
In addition the module is also what AngularJS uses to bootstrap an application. This tells angularJS what module
to load as the main entry point for the application by passing the module name into the ng-app directive.
Modules take two arguments. The first argument is the name of the module. The second argument is an array of module names
 that this module depends on. -->
